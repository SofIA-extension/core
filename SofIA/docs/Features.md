A user profile page: bio, photo, connected wallet, badge

A settings page:

### Core page:

**Echoes tab:**

- Result of browsing analysis by Eliza (gaia)
- Selection or deletion
- Onchain publication (option: grouped)

**Signals tab:**

- Filter signals by tag, predicate, or tierlist
- Copy link
- Display onchain signals via the intuition indexer

**Signals list:**

Allows the user to add a signal to a list. This list will then be loaded into the user's knowledge graph. Eliza will take this knowledge into account to refine its recommendations.

**Payment:**

The user must use credits to add a signal to a list. They can then rank these lists in order of importance using more credits.

Subscription system: No transaction pop-up required.

**Resonance tab:**

- Display the atoms with the highest weighting by topic or by connection to the user.

e.g., user like ableton > resonance result: Cubase, Fruityloops



### Sync Page:

This page serves as a space for the user to store their interests.

**Explore tab:**

- The user can explore atom lists shared among multiple users. - Their lists are sorted either by latest activity or by trend.

**Archive Tab:**

- The user can save a list of favorites that they can share with other users.
- The results displayed in the list lead to a page where the user can view the latest atom-related activities. (The atom is also part of the list...)
- If a user no longer wishes to see atoms added by another user, they can remove the user from their list. (Troll prevent)
