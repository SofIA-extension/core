# PRD - SOFIA Extension: Personal AI Agent for Web Browsing

## 1. Introduction / Overview

SOFIA is a Chrome extension that acts as a personal AI agent for web browsing, providing personalized suggestions, facilitating bookmark sharing within trust circles, checking on users, and certifying digital activity. The extension integrates with ElizaOS framework and Intuition.systems blockchain platform to analyze browsing patterns and create a verified digital identity through knowledge graph certification.

The extension addresses the problem of information overload and lack of personalized web experiences by creating an intelligent companion that learns from user behavior and provides contextual recommendations while maintaining privacy and ownership through blockchain verification.

- **Decentralized Storage**: User data ownership maintained through blockchain attestation

### SDK / Tooling:
- **Primary Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript for extension and web dashboard
- **Framework**: React 19 with Vite build system for UI components
- **Web3 Stack**: Wagmi, Viem, RainbowKit for blockchain interactions
- **Chrome APIs**: Manifest V3 service worker, Storage API, History API, Tabs API
- **ElizaOS SDK**: Custom MCP plugin integration for agent communication

## 6. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Eliza Network Integration**: Project does not use Hedera services directly
- **Cross-browser Support**: Chrome extension only, no Firefox/Safari versions
- **Real-time Collaboration**: No live co-browsing or shared sessions
- **Content Modification**: No injection or modification of web page content
- **Social Media Integration**: No direct posting or social platform connections
- **Mobile Application**: Extension-only, no mobile app development
- **Success Metrics Tracking**: No analytics or performance measurement system initially

## 7. Design Considerations

- **Extension UI**: side bar popup constraint with responsive Shadcn/UI components
- **Dashboard Design**: Modern web interface with Figma and Spline Motion
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant interface design
- **Performance**: Minimal resource usage, efficient background processing
- **Privacy-First**: Clear data handling indicators and user controls

## 8. Technical Considerations

### Architecture:
